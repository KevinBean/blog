# About this site
Hello and welcome to my space on the web! My name is Bin Bian, and I'm here to share a little about myself and my journey in the digital world.

I started out as an electrical engineer, but over the years I became fascinated with the power of cutting-edge digital tech, AI, and data science, and how it solves problems and makes things more efficient. I have a passion for exploring new and different areas within the field of digital transformation, building upon my foundation in problem-solving, analytical thinking, and technical expertise from my background in electrical engineering and ongoing studies.

# My Passion
I believe in digital transformation, which refers to integrating digital technology into all areas of a business or our personal life, resulting in fundamental changes to operations and delivering value to us. I love finding new and creative solutions to complex problems and exploring the latest trends and breakthroughs in the field. I believe that when engineering and computing come together, they can achieve amazing things.

The impact of digital technology on both personal and business life is phenomenal. Every day, we see new ways that technology is transforming how we live, work, and interact with the world. Whether through more efficient communication, smarter AI, or the creation of new and innovative products, digital transformation is changing our lives in countless positive ways.
